Example Project: Legacy Commodities Data Migration & Modern Pipeline Setup
ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Migrate commodity trade data from a legacy-like CSV storage into a modern Delta Lake architecture in Databricks, apply transformations, and expose the clean data for analytics.

ðŸ§± Step-by-Step Setup
1. Prepare Legacy Data
2. Create Ingestion (Bronze) Pipeline
3. Transform and Clean Data (Silver Layer)
4. Business Aggregations (Gold Layer)
5. Expose to Management
  Build a Databricks SQL dashboard over gold.trades_summary.
  Or connect Power BI/Tableau.
6. CI/CD with GitHub Actions:
  Automatically deploys notebooks to Dev / Prod environments (workspaces) using the Databricks REST API.
  Secrets handled via GitHub Actions + Databricks PAT.
7. Tests:
  Data validation tests (e.g., schema check, null checks) in pytest.
